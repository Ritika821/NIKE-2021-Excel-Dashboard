## Based on the report Insights, here are the outcomes :

This Dashboard consists of 2 pages operated by Buttons under Other Analysis box, these are Comparison Dashboard and Operating Margin Dashboard.

1. In this project, I have used Month Timeline Slicer, from which I derived that December month has maximum Sale of Nike product but Profit was bit lesser than maximum and in July there is maximum profit whereas in March there was the least Sale but not the least Profit, here February is the least profit month.

2. In this Line Chart, Men's Street Footwear has the highest Sale with the maximum Profit followed by Women's Apparel and Men's Athletic Footwear whereas Women's Athletic Footwear has lowest Sale with the least Profit followed by Men's Apparel and Women's Street Footwear. This means that for footwear company should focus on male members and for clothing company should focus on female members.
